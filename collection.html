        <p>Welcome to my anime web shrine~~! ^.^ ::glomps you:: I hope you're as big of an otaku as I am and this is a place to talk about anime and manga and vote on all of our favorite characters and cosplays!</p>
        <p>I went to my very first anime convention this year and I'm very excited to share more cosplays here on my page ^_^ I hope that cosplay becomes more popular and everybody sees how much fun it is, hehehehe. There's all kinds of cool stuff here on my page in the meantime: midis, gifs, a message board, and please don't forget to sign my guestbook!!! ^^ My greatest wish is that more people knew about how amazing anime was and that anime video tapes were everywhere just like in Japan <3</p>
